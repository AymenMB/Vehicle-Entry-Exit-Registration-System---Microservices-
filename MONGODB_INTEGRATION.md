# MongoDB Integration Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the MongoDB integration that has been implemented in the Vehicle Entry/Exit Registration System.

## Components Updated

1. **API Gateway**
   - Added MongoDB models for storing registration data
   - Updated REST API endpoints to use MongoDB for data persistence
   - Implemented proper async/await pattern in all database operations
   - Added new statistics endpoint for MongoDB data analysis

2. **Registration Consumer**
   - Updated to store registration events in MongoDB
   - Implemented proper error handling and retries

3. **UI Enhancements**
   - Added MongoDB Data Browser interface at `/database.html`
   - Updated main UI to include link to data browser

## MongoDB Data Structure

The primary data collection is `registrations` with the following schema:

- `registrationId` - Unique identifier for each registration
- `type` - Either 'entry' or 'exit'
- `timestamp` - When the registration occurred
- `plateData` - Object containing:
  - `plateNumber` - The detected license plate
  - `confidence` - Confidence level of plate detection
  - Other vehicle-related data
- `cinData` - Object containing:
  - `idNumber` - The person's ID number
  - `firstName`/`name` - Person's name
  - `lastName`/`lastname` - Person's surname
  - Other ID card related data

## Testing

Several testing tools have been created to verify MongoDB integration:

1. `test_mongodb.bat` - Tests basic MongoDB API endpoints
2. `test_mongodb_browser.bat` - Tests the MongoDB Data Browser
3. `verify_mongodb.ps1` - Comprehensive MongoDB integration verification

## Usage

### MongoDB Data Browser

Access the MongoDB Data Browser by:
1. Ensuring the API Gateway is running (`run_system.bat` or `run_system.ps1`)
2. Visiting http://localhost:3000/database.html in your browser
3. Or clicking the "MongoDB Data Browser" button in the footer of the main page

### MongoDB Statistics API

Access MongoDB statistics via the REST API:
```
GET /api/stats
```

Example response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "stats": {
    "total": 12,
    "entries": 8,
    "exits": 4,
    "uniqueVehicles": 3,
    "uniquePersons": 2,
    "today": {
      "entries": 2,
      "exits": 1,
      "total": 3
    },
    "latestRegistration": "2025-05-15T13:48:52.688Z"
  }
}
```

## Fixed Issues

The following issues were fixed during the MongoDB integration:

1. Corrected missing `await` statements in API endpoints
2. Ensured proper error handling in database operations
3. Fixed data retrieval issues in the registration lookup endpoint

## Conclusion

The system now successfully uses MongoDB as its data store, providing robust persistence and querying capabilities. All core functionality has been tested and verified to work with MongoDB.
